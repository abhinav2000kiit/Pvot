              To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic
              tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User
              ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily
              identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if
              we assign a cookie to your computer. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may
              also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not
              control. Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the
              Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets
              computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP
              address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon
              request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let
              advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.

                We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
                alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection,
                storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical
                security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. All
                information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database. The database is
                stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly
                limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We
                cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not
                be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you
                include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access. However the
                internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate
                necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with
                the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
